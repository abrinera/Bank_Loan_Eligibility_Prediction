The study focuses on assessing borrower eligibility for loan approval based on creditworthiness and risk scores in commercial loan lending. It proposes a machine learning-based approach to automate and enhance the loan validation process. The research integrates advanced data preprocessing techniques and a range of classification algorithms, including
 1. Logistic Regression
 2.  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
 3.  Random Forest
 4.  Decision Tree
 5.  Gradient Boosting
 6.  XGBoost
 7.  LightGBM
 8.  CatBoost
 9.  AdaBoost
 10.  Gaussian Naive Bayes
 11.  Multinomial Naive Bayes
 12.  Bernoulli Naive Bayes
     
as well as ensemble methods like Bagging and Voting. The goal is to improve prediction accuracy and expedite decision-making in the banking sector. After comparing models, Random Forest, XG Boost, and LightGBM achieved the highest accuracy rates of 83.65%, 82.42%, and 83.45%, respectively. Applying ensemble Bagging resulted in an accuracy of 82.98% from Random Forest, while Voting achieved 84.02%. After tuning, the voting parameters accuracy improved to 86.43%. Further applying 5-fold cross-validation and fine-tuning the Voting technique resulted in an accuracy of 87.18%.
